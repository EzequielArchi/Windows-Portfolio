## Features
The desktop contains different programs, each with their own set of features:

### Browser:
This application allows you to browse different web pages and has typical browser options such as the option to go back or forward in history, refresh the current page, go to a home page, or enter a URL in the search bar.  
Please note that not all pages allow connection within an embedded page for security reasons.

### Console:

### Resume:
Here you can find my resume in a file that you can view.

### Mail:

### Welcome:
A welcome message for the user.
